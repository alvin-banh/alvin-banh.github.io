        <p>
          I want to live a humble life. and i think that life veers off from a
          lot of expectations for me. but that's ok. I can't help but compare
          myself sometimes because i admit to seeking validation, even when i
          know its unhealthy. and we all want some validation. we all want to
          know we aren't completely lost. "good jobs" and high fives and all.
          like am i doing the right thing if nobody else wants to do the thing
          im doing? there would have to be something wrong with me if my passion
          was [insert niche thing]. we actively look for social proof with tried
          and true ways to success ... and stepping to the path less travelled
          is equivalent to suicide for someone who values security. and
          sometimes we convey it in a way that seems arrogant when we earn it.
          <br />
          ahem. a certain major.
          <br />
          yet both perspectives are pretty valid. if you've earned something,
          you are allowed to show people. if you've earned something, you are
          allowed to not show people. nobody is going to stop you. however, you
          can't fault people for having happy or sad feelings from their
          perceived self-worth, and you often can't predict when. and so it is
          important to be conscious of our actions, every silence and sound we
          make, and how they make others feel. it's hard to be warm and happy
          all the time to others ... in fact, exhausting. but as much as I would
          love to live in a vacuum and away from every person i know, i can't.
          it would be too hard to.
          <br />
          i think for a lot of people, they have the same feeling with different
          levels of certainty. maybe they are also students going through
          similar struggles, feeling like their talent in one area of their life
          accounts for a disproportionate amount of their self-worth. or maybe
          they don't like school but have something they really want to get good
          at. but as soon as it becomes a chore, it loses its luster. and i
          think the solution to learning without the requirement of learning is
          learning from someone else. and to have a buddy. someone on the same
          wavelength and that you can resonate with. here's some traits i look
          for, and maybe it will help people feel some a healthy amount of
          validation:
          <br />
          <br />
          evidence of hard work - i love tryhards. i love nerds. i'll tease you
          for it but because i could never share this sentiment in front of you.
          <br />
          <br />
          a trust of reciprocation - safety in knowing that days will be harder
          than others, yet people still find time for people they find
          invaluable. and maybe this is the easiest to exploit. hardest to keep.
          its a struggle to find the perfect equilibrium.
          <br />
          <br />
          empathy - because people mistake emotional regulation for suppression.
          feel emotions and seperate it from actions and goals. and never use
          stoicism as justification to minimize others. 
          <br />
          <br />
          supportiveness - because life is hard enough without people trying to
          tear you down. to feel unworthy of what you've built. to feel more
          undeserving than you already feel. and i've stopped letting the door
          open to those who want to trample me, regardless of how long the door
          was open for.
          <br />
          <br />
          respect - i'm a very reserved person. i like it that way. it feels
          invasive otherwise. and some may say it's weird but i wish people
          would say talk less about themselves or others. it feels special to
          learn something new about someone when its shared organically with a
          hint of confidentiality. people remind of a really good book; you can
          research the sparknotes and spoil it. or you can just ... read it.

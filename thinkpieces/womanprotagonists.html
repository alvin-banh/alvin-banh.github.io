        <h1>woman protagonists</h1>
        <p>
          Lately, I've been thinking about the shows that I have been really
          into. some may say i'm hyperfixated.
          <br />
          - Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
          <br />
          - Arcane
          <br />
          - The Apothecary Diaries
          <br />
          All of these have very compelling lead woman characters. And it feels
          very comforting to have these characters written so well. Frieren,
          Jinx, and Maomao all feel like people who are just really cool. They
          have their passions from magic to tinkering to ... poison drinking
          (not encouraging this one to people). They have downfalls and
          triumphs. Quirks and flaws. The best word I can use to describe the
          feeling of watching these shows is cozy (maybe less cozy for arcane).
          <br />
          In a lot of cases where women are portrayed as "empowered" in film and
          media, it sometimes feels like directors interpret that as "show proof
          that a woman can do more or equal to a man", which feels forced and
          disingenuous (<a

            >as knuckles once said... </a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          in reality, a lot of people are better at things than others,
          independent of gender. and it really sucks to see society use sexism
          as a way to deny recognition for people's abilities. many internalize
          these dynamics to justify deep insecurities and neglect because of the
          pressures placed on them by their communities. It often feels like a
          zero-sum game â€” like we have to diminish one group just to uplift
          another onto level ground. but true equity shouldn't come at the cost
          of someone else's value. rather creating space to thrive and support
          others hurt.
          <br />
          <br /> 
          we are teetering on the edge - if not in the midst - of a cultural
          moment where conversations around gender can feel hostile and full of
          blame. and too quickly is it turning sometimes reducing people's lived
          experiences to stereotypes or resentment. so we should all be a little
          bit better to each other. that's all.

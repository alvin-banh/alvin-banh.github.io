        <p>
          Lately, I've been thinking about the shows that I have been really
          into. some may say i'm hyperfixated.
          <br />
          - Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
          <br />
          - Arcane
          <br />
          - The Apothecary Diaries
          <br />
          All of these have very compelling lead woman characters. And it feels
          very comforting to have these characters written so well. Frieren,
          Jinx, and Maomao all feel like people who are just really cool. They
          have their passions from magic to tinkering to ... poison drinking
          (not encouraging this one to people). They have downfalls and
          triumphs. Quirks and flaws. The best word I can use to describe the
          feeling of watching these shows is cozy.
          <br />
          In a lot of cases where women are portrayed as "empowered" in film and
          media, it sometimes feels like directors interpret that as "show proof
          that a woman can do more or equal to a man", which feels forced and
          undermines gender equality (<a

          in reality, a lot of people are better at things than others,
          independent of gender. and it really sucks to see society use sexism
          as a way to deny this reality. or woman having to use "being better
          than a man" as external motivation or to prove themselves. or men who
          have internalized sexism by their community to feel insecure if a
          woman beats you. It often feels like a zero-sum game â€” like we have to
          diminish one group just to uplift another onto level ground. but true
          equality shouldn't come at the cost of someone else's value. rather
          creating space to thrive and support others hurt. so i think we should
          take our talents in vacuum and just say we are valuable for the merit
          of our character rather than gender. we are teetering on the edge - if not
          in the midst - of a gender war with social media filled with mutual hatred and
          confusion to the opposite gender. and too quickly is it turning to
          women resenting men and men's emotions being dismissed or unheard. so
          we should all be a little bit better to each other. that's all. 
          <br />

          highly recommend the shows above!

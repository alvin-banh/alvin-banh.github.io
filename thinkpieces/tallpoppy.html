        <p>
          i feel weird about saying i'm from mit.
          <br /><br />
          "aw boo hoo - cry more - be more grateful - die" is the kind of
          reaction i'd get ... albeit a bit dramatized. it would often be more
          subtle grudges and snide looks.
          <br /><br />
          but it's real. and it puts me in a bind when i talk to people outside
          the "ivy/top college" bubble. here's the idea:
        </p>
        <h1>dialogue 1: just be honest</h1>
        <p>
          person: "what school do you go to!?"
          <br />
          me: "i go to mit"
          <br />
          person: "wow that's so cool! i go to [insert college]"
          <br />
          me: "oh nice!"
          <br />
          <br />

          normal conversation between secure people ... right? well...
          <br />
          thoughts: now their perception of me is a lot higher. i have a lot
          more to prove - bigger shoes to fill. i will likely disappoint them.
          their expectation of me is so warped - they don't even consider the
          possibility that i could be a fucking idiot. in addition, my existence
          comes off as arrogant. i have to walk on eggshells with my words
          because even sharing a simple hobby or a quirk can trigger someone's
          insecurity. imagine the "i thought you went to [insert top college],
          you should know this" or "wow, i'm disappointed that an [insert top
          college] student doesn't know how to do [x thing]". then you do say something just to hear
          "wow they are so full of themselves" and "holy shit all they talk
          about is [insert top college]". hmmmm...
        </p>
        <h1>dialogue 2: i don't want to say...</h1>
        <p>
          person: "what school do you go to!?"
          <br />
          me: "i go to a trade school near boston"
          <br />
          person: "what school?"
          <br />
          me: "uhhhh"
          <br />
          person: "what school?"
          <br />
          me: "uhhhhhhhhhh ... mit (i say sheepishly with puppy dog eyes,
          praying they don't hurt me)"
          <br />
          person: "[eye roll]"
          <br />

          worse off conversation ... right? well...
          <br />
          thoughts: they think i'm obnoxious. i'm being "fake humble" as people
          say. my discomfort over a simple question becomes their reason
          to resent me. god this person hates my guts now. but what is the
          alternative? i say anything, i'm pretentious. i don't say anything,
          i'm weird. hmmmmm...
        </p>
        <h1>dialogue 3: lie</h1>
        <p>
          person: "what school do you go to!?"
          <br />
          me: "i go to hogwarts"
          <br />
          person: "what?"
          <br />
          me: "you know, like magic and shit"
          <br />
          person: "no i heard you but like..."
          <br />
          me: "i'm british and i play quidditch (author's note: not british, no
          nimbus)"
          <br />
          person: "i think i have to go ... "
          <br />
          me: "i'm also in gryffindor (author's note: buzzfeed says i'm
          hufflepuff)"
          <br />
          person: "[quickens pace to exit]"
          <br />
          hey that went pretty well!
        </p>
        <h1>ok so what now...</h1>
        <p>
          people will eventually know where my diploma and ssri prescription is
          from. it's like one linkedin search and a stereotype away. but it is
          hard when you grew up not to stand out and then standing out when all
          you want to do is bury your ostrich head in the ground for longer. one
          reason i think i got in was failing fast and often - whether it be 6
          am, demon hour, college essay revisions or practice tests with the god
          forbidden "15 minute nap". but now it feels like, to not be executed
          like a witch in massachusetts between february 1692 to may 1693, i
          need to meet unreasonable expectations of perfection. i can't fail
          because i go to a school that makes me ostracized by default. it
          doesn't help that my "i failed" feel order of magnitudes more
          significant when i'm expected to succeed handily for all academic
          scenarios.
          <br />
          <br />
          this really stifled me socially. it felt like an extra condition to
          manage how people react to me when in reality, i should be indifferent
          to it. i felt as though i couldn't talk about things i've wanted to
          talk about because my passion can easily be braggy. and when i do get
          to talk about them, subtle comments get brought up in weird ways to
          try to undermine me. like poking holes in me to make me more human but
          not like funny "haha you tripped and fell and looked stupid" holes but
          more like "i resent you deeply and i'll make it known but i can just
          play it as a joke to avoid repercussion" holes. those are less funny.
          all of these emotions get bottled up by nature because i end up
          feeling too dumb to relate to mit students and resented for being too
          "smart" (whatever that means).
          <br />
          <br />
          i think what people say for advice sounds right but is often
          misleading or not enough to confront the problem. the "be proud of
          yourself" and "don't be afraid to show your worth" can only go so far
          when you keep getting negative social feedback of the thought of
          disappointing every new person you meet. i wish i was treated
          "normally" but for the longest time, i didn't know how to ask for this
          or what it looked like. and it didn't feel like anybody really cared
          to try to sympathize or validate this sentiment. so now, i see all
          projections of insecurity like software engineering resumes at a
          career fair. comments have no value to me unless for concrete proof of
          character rather my education ... and i'll see if this works out for
          me. but i thought it would be important to say everything here for any
          of my high achieving homies feeling like they have to downplay
          themselves to feel safe.
          <br />
          <br />
          all this to say, i'm taking defense against the dark arts next
          semester so if anyone took the class last year, hmu.
